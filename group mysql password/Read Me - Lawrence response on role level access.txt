We understand that the member should have the same access as visitor but can access archive as an addition.

L: Yes, that is correct.

Does this mean after the user logs in, he should still be able to see the login and registration since these two are also 
in the list of what the visitors will be seeing?

L:Good question. No, once a user is logged in, the registration and login pages should not be available. Instead, they should 
see a logout option. This applies to both members and authors.

We’re a bit confused about this since normally the user won’t be able to access log in if he hasn’t logged out (we have a logout
option) and since he’s logged in, he shouldn’t be registering (this option is normally for the new user (which is a visitor))?

L:Yes, your reasoning is spot on. Hopefully my answer above clears this up.

At the moment our visitor is seeing:

Homepage 

About 

Registration

Login

L: Good


Our member after logging in is seeing 

Homepage 

About 

Logout 

Archive

Author

Homepage

Logout

L:Good


The only other thing you might need to factor in is access for any additional pages added as part of additional 
features/embellishments. The access for these is largely up to your group, though it is likely that additional 
pages would be restricted to member and/or author roles.
